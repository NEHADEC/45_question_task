//Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.
//• Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.

// • Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list.
//  Each time you pop a name from your list,
//  print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.

// • Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.
let guest_list :string[] = ['lamiha', 'mahnoor','dania','zariyan','neha'];
// • Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list.
//  Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.
