//question no 26

//Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25,

let alien_color: string = "blue";

// and write an if-else chain.

// • If the alien’s color is green,

//print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

if(alien_color === "blue"){
    console.log("player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.");
    
}else{
    console.log("player just earned 10 point");
    
}


// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

alien_color = "black"
if(alien_color === "blue"){
    console.log("player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.");
    
}else{
    console.log("player just earned 10 point");
    
}



// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.
